Introduction: This is the README for assignment 4, random testing. There are three random card tests. This code is testing buggy code for the cards, with a focus on finding where the code fails to execute as expected. The tests were not written to explicitly find the bugs.The cards being tested are adventurer, smithy, and great_hall.

Makefile: This project uses a Makefile. To execute, first ensure permissions are set by using chmod +x Makefile. Then run the tests using:

make randomtestsresults

Output: The output of the code is sent to the file randomtestsresults.out

The output file contains the full cat of the gcov results for each test.
